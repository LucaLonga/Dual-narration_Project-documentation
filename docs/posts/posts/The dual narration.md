# The dual narration

The narrative attempts to reconstruct the incident and attribute responsibility.

The OSINT tool is used to identify:
- which moments of the action (pursuit) can be identified as police abuse
- whether in the final accident the car did or did not contribute to the collision and in what way

Multiple intended conclusions are possible:
* Prove that the Carabinieri were at fault
* Prove that the Carabinieri were not at fault
* Prove that Fares Bouzidi were at fault
* Prove that Fares Bouzidi were not at fault
* Prove that there was a contributory negligence
* Prove the impossibility of attribute fault on the basis of the evidence provided
* Prove the impossibility of attributing fault on the basis of the evidence provided and suggest that the absence of evidence is intentional

The investigation is intended to show that the available evidence is sufficient to establish fault or to exonerate the Carabinieri from fault. In other words, the two narrations will be:



| The available evidence shows that Ramy's death was the responsibility of the Carabinieri | The available evidence shows that Ramy's death was NOT the responsibility of the Carabinieri |
|-|-|
| The pursuit was not conducted in a lawful manner and/or there was a malicious intent in the way the pursuit was conducted | The pursuit was conducted in a lawful manner and there was no malicious intent in the way the pursuit was conducted |
| The accident sees partial or total responsibility on the part of the Carabinieri car in the death of Ramy | The accident does not see any responsibility on the part of the Carabinieri car in the death of Ramy |
|Help was not called immediately | Help was called in a timely manner |
