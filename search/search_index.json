The scope of action intersects with Critical design in its ability to question the status quo of reality and deal with contemporary topics of information manipulation and narrative weaponisation in the digital era. While the project deals mainly with intentional framing of a narration in a more or less specific ideology, its outputs could also be applied to a more accidental scenario where biases, mistakes, or a lack of information could occur. Reflecting on the relationship between content and form, the focus will first concentrate on the rhetorical construction of the artefact(s) before shifting again to the visual tools implicated.</p>"},{"location":"posts/Hello_OSINT/#research-question-and-goal","title":"Research question and goal","text":"<p>What is the correlation between visual grammar and the trustworthiness of a narration in the current practice of OSINT investigations?

The idea of blending these tools with Critical design and Critical media theories approach, allows me to test myself on a full OSINT-like process, giving me the opportunity to then share my findings with the rest of the MA community. Further, the discourse around the manipulation of media and narratives, the role of the visual designer in shaping power and the rising needs of a interdisciplinary approach to the journalism are, form my point of view, among the most compelling topics of our present times.</p>"}]}
